Cardinal is a free and open-source virtual modular synthesizer plugin.
It is based on the popular VCV Rack but with a focus on being a fully self-contained plugin version.

Cardinal provides 3 plugin variants - "main", Synth and FX.
They are all equivalent in performance and behaviour, with only the IO and metadata that changes.

FX and Synth variants both have 2 audio outputs, while "main" has 8.
All variants have MIDI input and output support.

This package provides the AU, LV2, VST2 and VST3 audio plugins for macOS.

Notes:
 - Due to AU and VST2 not supporting CV ports, the main variant is not available for these formats.
 - The VST3 version is in progress, already part of the build but still experimental.
